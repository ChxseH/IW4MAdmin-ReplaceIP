# IW4MAdmin-ReplaceIP
Replaces first IPAddress Key with a new one (recursively)

# Why?

Simple: I have two dynamic IPs. One is hosting Game Servers, one is hosting [IW4MAdmin](https://github.com/RaidMax/IW4M-Admin). I'm too lazy to keep updating the [IW4MAdminSettings.json](https://github.com/RaidMax/IW4M-Admin#advanced-configuration) file every time my IP changes. Here's a script to automate it.


# Requirements

* [This PHP File on a web server.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChxseH/PHP-ShowIP/main/pub.php)
* Python 3
* Windows
* CURL
* IW4MAdmin
